## Top Hosts

### Most Listing

```sql
select h.host_id, h.host_name, count(l.id) as total_listings
from host_table h
join listings_table l on h.host_id = l.host_id
group by h.host_id, h.host_name
order by total_listings desc
limit 10;
```

### Earn Most

First, delete the "$" and turn it into float. 

```sql
update listings_table
set price = cast(replace(price, '$', '') as decimal(10, 2))
where price is not null;

alter table listings_table 
modify price float;
```

Then, we estimate the historical earnings using number of reviews.

```sql
select h.host_id, h.host_name, sum(l.price * r.number_of_reviews) as total_earnings
from host_table h
join listings_table l on h.host_id = l.host_id
join availability_table a on l.id = a.listing_id
join review_table r on l.id = r.listing_id
group by h.host_id, h.host_name
order by total_earnings desc
limit 10;
```

### Rate Highest

```sql
select h.host_id, h.host_name, avg(r.review_scores_rating) as avg_rating
from host_table h
join listings_table l on h.host_id = l.host_id
join review_table r on l.id = r.listing_id
where r.review_scores_rating is not null
group by h.host_id, h.host_name
order by avg_rating desc
limit 10;
```

    group by h.host_id

    join availability_table a on l.id = a.listing_id
    join review_table r on l.id = r.listing_id

### Key Observations

**Table 1: Total Reviews per Neighborhood**

- Top Neighborhoods by Total Reviews:
  - **Jamaica Plain**: 9055 reviews, indicating this is the most popular or active neighborhood in terms of visitor feedback.
  - **Dorchester**: 7396 reviews, suggesting high engagement or listing activity.
  - **South End**: 5714 reviews, also among the busiest neighborhoods.
- Bottom Neighborhoods:
  - **Leather District**: 69 reviews, indicating either low listing activity or visitor interest.
  - **Bay Village** and **Mattapan**: Both have low engagement, with 241 and 157 reviews respectively.

**Meaning/Insights**:

- The total reviews suggest **popularity** and **visitor activity** across neighborhoods. High-review neighborhoods are likely hotspots for tourism or rentals.
- Neighborhoods with low reviews could indicate underutilized opportunities or less attractive options for visitors.

**Table 2: Total Listings per Neighborhood**

- Top Neighborhoods by Total Listings:
  - **Jamaica Plain**: 343 listings, matching its high total reviews, indicating both popularity and abundant accommodations.
  - **South End** and **Back Bay**: 326 and 302 listings respectively, confirming their prominence in rental availability.
- Bottom Neighborhoods:
  - **Leather District**: 5 listings, which aligns with its low total reviews, suggesting very limited rental options.
  - **Longwood Medical Area** and **Mattapan**: Each has few listings.

**Meaning/Insights**:

- The total listings reflect **supply** in each neighborhood. More listings suggest areas with high property owner interest or demand for accommodations.
- Low-listing neighborhoods might represent areas with low property availability or lesser interest from hosts.

**Comparative Insights Between the Two Tables**:

- **High Reviews and High Listings**: Neighborhoods like *Jamaica Plain* and *South End* have both high review numbers and listing numbers, indicating both **high demand and supply**.
- **High Reviews but Lower Listings**: A neighborhood with relatively fewer listings but high review numbers like *Dochester* might indicate **business potentials**.
- **Low Reviews and Low Listings**: Neighborhoods like *Leather District* and *Longwood Medical Area* are less active, suggesting underutilization or limited demand.

## Busiest Times and Price Spikes

To assess how prices spike during the busiest periods, we'll calculate the average price per month and compare it to the annual average price.

```sql
with monthly_avg_price as (
    select 
        extract(month from c.date) as month,
        avg(c.price) as avg_monthly_price
    from calendar_table c
    group by month
),
annual_avg as (select avg(price) as avg_price from calendar_table)
select 
    m.month,
    m.avg_monthly_price,
    round(((m.avg_monthly_price - a.avg_price) / a.avg_price) * 100, 2) as price_spike_percentage
from monthly_avg_price m, annual_avg a
order by m.month;
```

![image-price_spike](./Boston Airbnb Data Analysis/image/Screenshot 2024-12-08 at 9.13.56â€¯PM.png)


### Key Observations

#### **1. Peak Months: September and October**

- **September (Month 9)** and **October (Month 10)** exhibit the highest average monthly prices at **$231.52** and **$230.27** respectively.
- **Price Spike Percentages** for these months are **+20.78%** and **+20.12%**, indicating a substantial increase compared to the annual average.
- **Implications:**
  - These significant price spikes suggest a **high demand** during these months, likely driven by factors such as favorable weather, fall foliage, academic calendars, and major events in Boston.
  - Hosts capitalize on this increased demand by raising prices, maximizing revenue during peak seasons.

#### **2. Off-Peak Months: January to March**

- **January (Month 1), February (Month 2), and March (Month 3)** show the lowest average monthly prices at **$178.36**, **$175.86**, and **$175.93** respectively.
- **Price Spike Percentages** for these months are **-6.95%**, **-8.26%**, and **-8.22%**, indicating a decrease relative to the annual average.
- **Implications:**
  - These months represent **off-peak periods** with lower demand, possibly due to colder weather, fewer tourists, and a post-holiday slowdown.
  - Lower prices incentivize travelers to book accommodations, providing opportunities for hosts to maintain occupancy rates despite reduced demand.
